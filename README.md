# Arrow's Impossibility Theorem

[![CI](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-arrows-theorem/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-arrows-theorem/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Coq formalization of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Based on the first
(informal) proof in [Three Brief Proofs of Arrow's Impossibility
Theorem](http://dido.econ.yale.edu/~gean/art/p1116.pdf) by John Geanakoplos.

Might want to switch to [A Straightforward Proof of Arrow's
Theorem](https://www.rochester.edu/college/faculty/markfey/papers/ArrowProof3.pdf)
as a basis.
